Welcome to Hexatech - a web application project aimed at demonstrating the integration of PHP and MySQL to dynamically render product details on a website. In this project, I've utilized the Bootstrap framework for styling and layout, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design. The backend functionality is powered by PHP, which retrieves product information stored in a MySQL database and dynamically renders it on the website. By exploring this repository, you'll gain insights into how PHP can be used to create dynamic web applications, fetching and displaying data seamlessly. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the functionalities, and provide feedback.
